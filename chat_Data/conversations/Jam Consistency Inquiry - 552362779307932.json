            "content": "No, meat broth does not make jam thicker. Jam thickness is typically achieved through the use of pectin, which is a natural thickening agent found in fruits. When making jam, sugar and pectin help to create the desired gel-like consistency during the cooking process. Meat broth, being a liquid made from cooking meat and often containing fats and proteins, would not contribute to the thickening process of jam. In fact, adding broth to jam could alter its flavor and texture negatively. For best results, stick to traditional jam-making ingredients."
